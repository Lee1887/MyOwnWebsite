        <h2>About-Me</h2> 
        My name is Luca Lee Vincent Staudt and I live in Asperg, a small town near Stuttgart.
        I am 24 years old and currently enrolled in a web development bootcamp.
        I could never truly live and learn carefree because of some later diagnosed illnesses.
        I've been in treatment and receiving medication since last year in order to live a normal life.
        In the following texts, I will explain who I am, my interests, my goals (both personal and professional), 
        and how you can contact me.
        <p></p>
         So be inquisitive!

    <h2>MyLife</h2>
My life is somewhat chaotic.
I was a very good and ambitious student until the eighth grade; I have an IQ of 126 and a "photographic memory."
When I hit puberty, like everyone else, I became increasingly tired, limp, and unable to concentrate,
and everyone blamed it on puberty.
School became mediocre, and even my first degree did not go as planned.
I was diagnosed with Klinefelter's syndrome in the spring of 2020,
which means I don't produce testosterone, which manifests as fatigue.
I was diagnosed with ADS in the summer of 2021; unfortunately, there is little help for adults,
so you have to help yourself.My grades improved as a result of the medication, 
but I decided to discontinue my studies and enroll in a boot camp.
I still have one more autism appointment scheduled.
I'll keep you updated; my life is chaotic...but never boring.

    <h2>Hobbys</h2>
    My hobbies include open water swimming over longer distances ranging from 5 to 25 kilometers.
    A former classmate introduced me to ice swimming; unfortunately, Corona did not organize any German championships,
     but I did swim competitively a few times.
    Swimming in ice water is purely mental for me, as the water is 0-5 degrees and no wetsuits are permitted.
    Another hobby is private flying; I don't have a pilot's license yet,
     but I go flying once a month with friends and can already fly practically.
    History, old castles, and meeting friends from different countries are some of my other interests.

    <section id="Targets"class="#Targets"></section>
    <h2>Targets</h2>
    I, like everyone else, have personal and professional goals.
    I'll begin with my personal objectives.
    The main goal is to swim the English Channel from France to England, 
    after which I want to live in the UK, have a house with a natural pool, and travel extensively.
    Professionally, I'd like to establish myself as a "very good" web developer specializing in cyber-security over the next few years, 
    possibly start my own company, and listen to at least 1-2 apps.
    At 35, I'd like to be financially secure enough to travel the world for a year, 
    gathering new ideas for exciting projects, experiencing different cultures, and possibly assisting others in realizing their dreams.
